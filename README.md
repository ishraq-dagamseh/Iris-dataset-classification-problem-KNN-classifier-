# Iris-dataset-classification-problem-KNN-classifier-
This is a classification problem to classify Iris rose category based on 4 feature:('sepal_length',	'sepal_width','petal_length','petal_width')
we applied these steps until measure the performance of the KNN classifier:
# 1. Read data
# 2. Analyse the data
  ## 2.1 show the amout of labels and explore if it is an balanced or imbalanced data:

  and we noticed that were a balanced data

  ## 2.2 Missing data exploration using graph

  And we noticed that hasnt any missing data.
# 3. Preprocess data 
  ## 3.1 label Encoding technique
Iin this step we just need to convert labels into numerical data. and we used label Encoding technique
  ## 3.2 Normalize the numerical feature using Min Max scalar

# 4. split data into training and testing with 0.25 for testing
# 5.Train the model (KNN with different k's(4 and 3)
# 6. evaluate the performance using different metrices, like confusion matrix and classification report
